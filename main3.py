So essentially I had no sleep from yesterday till today 12 pm. After which I tried sleeping but couldn't fall asleep. It literally broke me from inside, I have had pulled all nighters in the past but that was due to travel, my personal work or some celebrations etc.\n\nBut this time I completely feel broken from inside, knowing that I'll have to do this continously for the coming 4 days and then once at the beginning of every month.\n\nI don't know why but this just feels like torture to me.",
